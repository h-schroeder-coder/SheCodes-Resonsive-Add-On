            <h3>Ireland is often called the "Emerald Isle"</h3>
            <p>
              Due to its lush green landscapes and rolling hills, a result of
              its rainy climate. But there are also large areas of rugged, rocky
              landscape, too. About 15,000 years ago, Ireland was completely
              covered by thick glaciers. The movement of these giant sheets of
              ice stripped the soil, leaving huge tracts of flat, limestone
              ground.

            <h3>Castles abound</h3>
            <p>
              Ireland has an estimated 30,000 castles, many of which are ruins
              with rich medieval stories. Blarney Castle, Bunratty Castle and
              Cahir Castle are some of the castles well worth visiting.

                cooks food from the heart, bakes its own bread fresh every day,
                takes its coffee seriously, plays around with fermented foods,
                gathers influences from around the world and uses local
                ingredients to bring it all together.

                Our food is honest and no frills. Sometimes we like to get all
                fancy. But mostly its simple and thoughtful and what happens
                before it comes to us is just as important as what happens
                after.
